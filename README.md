## Discord

1. Create a new application in the Discord Developer Portal

   - Documentation: [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

2. Create a bot for your application

   - Documentation: [Discord Bot](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#registering-a-command)

## üöÄ Setup

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/benminer/discord-audio-streamer.git
   cd discord-audio-streamer
   ```

2. Set up your environment variables:

   ```bash
   cp common.env .env
   ```

3. Configure your `.env` file with the required parameters found in `common.env`

## üî® Build & Run

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```

2. Build the project:

   ```bash
   go build -o discord-bot
   ```

3. Run the bot:
   ```bash
   ./discord-bot
   ```

## üê≥ Docker

1.  Build the Docker image:

    ```bash
    docker build -t discord-music-bot:latest ./
    ```

    **Note for Apple Silicon users:** If you are building the Docker image on an Apple Silicon Mac, you may need to use `docker buildx` to build an image that is compatible with your architecture. For example:

    ```bash
    docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t discord-music-bot:latest .
    ```

2.  Run the Docker container:

    ```bash
    docker run -d --name discord-music-bot \
      --restart always \
      --memory="1g" \
      --memory-reservation="512m" \
      --memory-swap="2g" \
      --cpus="2" \
      --cpu-shares="2048" \
      -e DISCORD_APP_ID=$DISCORD_APP_ID \
      -e DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY=$DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY \
      -e DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=$DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN \
      -e ENFORCE_VOICE_CHANNEL=$ENFORCE_VOICE_CHANNEL \
      -e YOUTUBE_API_KEY=$YOUTUBE_API_KEY \
      -e GEMINI_API_KEY=$GEMINI_API_KEY \
      -e GEMINI_ENABLED=$GEMINI_ENABLED \
      -e NGROK_AUTHTOKEN=$NGROK_AUTHTOKEN \
      -e NGROK_DOMAIN=$NGROK_DOMAIN \
      -e SENTRY_DSN=$SENTRY_DSN \
      discord-music-bot:latest
    ```

    I recommend setting at least 1GB, with 2GB of swap, since songs are stored in memory while streaming.

## üíª Development

## üôè Acknowledgments

This project makes use of several excellent open-source libraries that I couldn't have built this without.
